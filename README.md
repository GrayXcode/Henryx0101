Hi, I am Henry Nnamani, Currently a student of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and majoring in Computer Science while also being a self taught developer.
I'm interested in Web development and if possible in the future I would love to venture into Blockchain development, but I am currently learning javaScript.
I'm looking to collaborate on projects or startup that don't actually scale but have people with strong drive.
You can contact me on +234 07052899465, which is also my whatsapp number.
